		<h3>Here are some major bullet points for attendance:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>If you are not fully vaccinated and aged 2 or older, you should wear a mask in indoor public places.</li>
			<li>In general, you do not need to wear a mask in outdoor settings.</li>
				<ul>
					<li>In areas with high numbers of COVID-19 cases, consider wearing a mask in crowded outdoor settings and for activities with close contact with others who are not fully vaccinated.</li>
				</ul>
			<li>People who have a condition or are taking medications that weaken their immune system may not be fully protected even if they are fully vaccinated. They should continue to take all precautions recommended for unvaccinated people, including wearing a well-fitted mask, until advised otherwise by their healthcare provider.</li>
			<li>If you are fully vaccinated, to maximize protection from the Delta variant and prevent possibly spreading it to others, wear a mask indoors in public if you are in an area of substantial or high transmission.</li>
			<li>If you are fully vaccinated, see When Youâ€™ve Been Fully Vaccinated.</li>
